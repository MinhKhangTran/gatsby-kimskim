# gatsby-kimskim
kims kim kimbo

This project is inspired by wes bos. His course is super good. I learned a lot even though i'm kinda familiar with gatsby. Thanks wes bos for your course. Was the money worth xD. As Styling I tried Chakra Ui. It is similiar to Tailwind and I must say I like both. Styling makes so much fun with them. I will use them in the future a lot :D

I like gatsby. I think I will practice it a while before i start something new. I am planning to update my blog. I plan to move away from mdx and put everything in Sanity or ohter headless cms. And thanks for wes for this good introduction to Sanity.
